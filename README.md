Rectify-Match-Reconstruct (RMR) is an integrated framework for dense and accurate metric 3D reconstruction to enable condition assessment of civil structures. Via iterative neural homography rectification, the wide-baseline discrepancies between image pairs is significantly mitigated, allowing for accurate pixel-wise correspondence for dense 3D reconstruction.
